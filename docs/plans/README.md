# Plans

Task breakdowns for platform features. Written AFTER design, BEFORE implementation. Implementing agents read the plan before writing code.

Plans are permanent records — they stay after the feature ships as historical documentation of how features were built.

See `docs/development-process.md` for when to write a plan and how plans fit in the development stack.

## Template

status: planned | in-progress | done
date: YYYY-MM-DD
